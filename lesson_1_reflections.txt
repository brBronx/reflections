How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
  The comparison saves having to read line-by-line which too often makes it difficult to spot the differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  It makes it easy to see the evolution of what worked and what didn't.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
  Pros - You are in control to determine when significant changes have been made.  Cons - you may delay too long before doing another commit so that too many changes have been made.
