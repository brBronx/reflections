What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  A .git file is created to contain metadata.  The repository allows saving of programs periodically with the ability
  to compare later and earlier versions.
  
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  Staging area is the first level of commit from the working directory where active work is being done.  The Staging area
  does permit recall prior to a commit to the repository by using the 'git reset file_name' command.
