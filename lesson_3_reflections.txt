When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there are multiple people working on a project or when access is needed from different workstations.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You may not be aware that others have posted to GitHub.  So, if a pull is done automatically, you may end up with      unexpected changes.
